# AngularBasicsPractice

## The Repo

Sole purpose of this repo is practicing some basics for Angular.
Not a real goal was set for myself, just some hours spending on Angular for practice.


## Challenges

First time using a custom directive which required a lot of unneccesary config.


Passing components and passing HTML elements provided me with (too) many new options. 
 ```
 getApproval(cb: HTMLInputElement)
 ```

## Things I learned
* Input + Output
* Passing components
* Custom directives
